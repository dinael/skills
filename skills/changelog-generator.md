# Changelog Generator

This skill transforms technical git commits into polished, user-friendly changelogs that your customers and users will actually understand and appreciate.

## When to Use This Skill

- Preparing release notes for a new version
- Creating weekly or monthly product update summaries
- Documenting changes for customers
- Writing changelog entries for app store submissions
- Generating update notifications
- Creating internal release documentation
- Maintaining a public changelog/product updates page

## What This Skill Does

1. **Scans Git History**: Analyzes commits from a specific time period or between versions
2. **Categorizes Changes**: Groups commits into logical categories (features, improvements, bug fixes, breaking changes, security)
3. **Translates Technical → User-Friendly**: Converts developer commits into customer language
4. **Formats Professionally**: Creates clean, structured changelog entries
5. **Filters Noise**: Excludes internal commits (refactoring, tests, etc.)
6. **Follows Best Practices**: Applies changelog guidelines and your brand voice

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

From your project repository:

``` text
Create a changelog from commits since last release
```

``` text
Generate changelog for all commits from the past week
```

``` text
Create release notes for version 2.5.0
```

### With Specific Date Range

``` text
Create a changelog for all commits between March 1 and March 15
```

### With Custom Guidelines

``` text
Create a changelog for commits since v2.4.0, using my changelog
guidelines from CHANGELOG_STYLE.md
```
